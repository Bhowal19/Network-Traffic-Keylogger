🎉 Welcome to the Integrated Network Traffic Analysis & Keylogger Project! 🚀 This versatile project showcases expertise in network programming and cybersecurity concepts. It features a custom packet sniffer with Python's Scapy library for real-time analysis of network packets, enabling the identification of threats and network issues. Additionally, a discreet keylogger is implemented to securely log keystrokes.

## Introduction

In this project, we demonstrate proficiency in networking tools, user input monitoring, and data security. The `packet_callback` function provides detailed insights into network packets, while the keylogger runs seamlessly as a background process, capturing keystrokes without interfering with the user experience. The keylogger can be controlled and terminated using the 'Esc' key. 🔒

Our project signifies the ability to contribute to network monitoring, analysis, and user-centric applications. Whether you are interested in network security, traffic analysis, or user activity monitoring, this project serves as a solid foundation for further exploration.

## Features

- Real-time network packet analysis using a custom packet sniffer.
- Detection and identification of potential threats in network traffic.
- Secure and discreet keylogger to log user keystrokes.
- Background operation of the keylogger without interrupting user activities.
- Controlled termination of the keylogger using the 'Esc' key.
- Detailed insights into network packets and captured keystrokes.
